# Game of Life
Game project called: Game of Life. Created by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970


## The rules of the game
The game was invented in 1970 by a British mathematician, John Conway. In the simplest terms, the game constitutes an imitation (simulation) of life. Within the game, the world is represented by a 2D grid, while each element of the grid, referred to as cell, represents living being. 

The evolution of life is subject to certain grand rules; that is, whether the cell survives or dies from one stage of the simulation to the next one is determined by the following conditions. The cell survives if 1) it is alive and it has exactly 2 alive neighbours (cells within distance of 1 from the current cell); or 2) it has exactly 3 alive neighbours, regardless of whether it currently is alive or dead. In all other cases, sadly, the cell dies.
